Command to connect: Use your VNC client and connect to server-ip:5901.


2. Install RDP with IPv6
Configures TigerVNC to bind to all IPv6 addresses.
Command to connect: Use your VNC client and connect to [server-ip]:5901.


3. Install RDP without IPv4 and IPv6
Configures TigerVNC to listen on localhost only. Use SSH tunneling for secure access.
Command to set up SSH tunnel:

How to Connect

1. Install a VNC client like TigerVNC Viewer, RealVNC, or TightVNC on your computer.


2. Use the following connection strings based on your setup:

IPv4: server-ip:5901

IPv6: [server-ip]:5901

Localhost (via SSH tunnel): localhost:5901

Uninstallation

To remove TigerVNC and related configurations:

sudo apt-get remove --purge tigervnc-standalone-server tigervnc-common -y
sudo apt-get autoremove -y
rm -rf ~/.vnc

Troubleshooting

1. TigerVNC Service Issues:

Check the service status:

systemctl status vncserver@:1.service

Restart the service:

systemctl restart vncserver@:1.service



2. Connection Refused:

Ensure the port (5901) is open if using IPv4/IPv6.

For localhost mode, confirm the SSH tunnel is active.



3. VNC Client Black Screen:

Ensure the ~/.vnc/xstartup file is correctly configured:

# Content of ~/.vnc/xstartup
#!/bin/bash
xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
startxfce4 &

Make it executable:

chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup
